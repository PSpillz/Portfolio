# Project-Data-Science
This is for the final project for BIO 316, with specific functions and data applied. I am Patrick Spillane, I am a student at Stonehill College and am currently going to be starting my senior year next fall. After Stonehill, I wish to go to Graduate School for Ecological Studies and coding and programming can very much help with that endeavor.
