# Project-Data-Science
This is for the final project for BIO 316, with specific functions and data applied. I am Patrick Spillane, I am a student at Stonehill College and am currently going to be starting my senior year next fall. This portfolio contains many homework assignments that I had done for the "R Programming for Biologists" class I took in the summer of 2023 and one of them is a large Function Tutorial project. This project went over three functions that I chose, how they work, and possible uses for them. These three functions were fishualize::fish, a hexadecimal code creator which depended on the scientific name of the species of fish that was selected, fishualize::fishualize, a similar function which instead gave a range of colors that appear on the selected species of fish selected. And fishbc::fbc_common_name, which tells the common name of fish species selected in a database of species of fish that live in British Columbia. 
There are also several homework assignments that show off my experience in R.
Week 1 (Spillane_Week1): This assignment was to get a good grasp of R and doing basic tasks such as describing certain functions and converting pounds to kilograms.
